# Sumz - Article Summarizer Application

## Description

Sumz is an article summarizer application that utilizes OpenAI's GPT model to generate concise summaries of long articles. It provides users with a convenient way to extract key information and main points from lengthy texts, saving them time and effort.

The application is built using ReactJS and is set up using Vite, a fast build tool for modern web development. This ensures efficient development and a smooth development experience.

The user interface of Sumz is designed with a focus on responsiveness and a beautiful UI/UX. It incorporates the trendy glass morphism design style using Tailwind CSS, providing a modern and visually pleasing experience for users.

The application utilizes advanced RTK query API requests that fire conditionally, allowing for optimized data fetching and improved performance. This ensures that only necessary API requests are made based on user actions and requirements.

To enhance user experience and convenience, Sumz implements a local storage feature to save history. This allows users to access their previously summarized articles and review them at any time without the need for re-summarization.

Sumz also handles form events and catches errors effectively, providing a smooth and error-free user experience. The application ensures a seamless summarization process, handling any unexpected scenarios gracefully.

In addition, Sumz includes a copy to clipboard functionality, enabling users to easily copy the generated summaries to their clipboard and share or use them as needed.
